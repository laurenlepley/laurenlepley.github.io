    <i><h1> What led me to pursure art?</h1></i>

    <br>

    <p> Art has always been a defining passion for me. It was something I could always go to as a means of expressing myself. I took several art classes through my high school journey and I can never remmeber I time where I didn't feel happy. Art allows me to be myself and I have the freedom to create whatever comes to my mind. Colors are beautiful and I enjoy the ability to use them. I also felt that I never had to be better than anyone else when it came to art because I had my own style. Choosing Studio Art as a carrer may bring skepticism to other people but it is truly something that I want to do the rest of my life. </p>

    <i><h1> Most used art mediums?</h1></i>

    <br>

    <p> The mediums that I use the most are oil paint, watercolor paint, and graphic pencils. During my years in highschool, I really only every painted using actylics because that is the medium I had the most access to. I enjoyed it but the saying that "once you try oil paint, youll never go back to acrylic" is absolutely true. The ability to go back to the same spot and continue blending or critquing days after the initial paint has been applied is truly helpful. Once I got used to oils and tried to paint with acrylics, I had the hardest time becuae of how fast it ended up drtying. Oil paint also gives much richer colors. The jewel tones are beautiful and help liven the painting to its fullest extent. Watercolor paints are almost opposite of oils. They can dry fast like acrylic and they have softer colors. However, I find a charm with watercolors. I fell in live with them my senior year of highschool where I had more freedom to use mediums without a project requirement. Graphite pencils are a staple for artists. Whether theyre used to draw sketches for larger artworks or detialed shading, graphite pencils are most likely one of the most used mediums for artists. Whenever I make art without using paints, I end up uding graphite pencils.</p>

    <i><h1>Why 'Rinnydingding'?</h1></i>

    <br>

    <p> My name is Lauren. I wanted to find a nickname for myself in highschool but Lauren couldn't really get any shorter. That's when I thought of "Rin" or "Rinny". I thought it was a cute, short name. So, when I came up with a username, Rinnydingding came to mind. It's also a bit of play on sound. Rinnydingding ~ ringa-ding-ding. Get it? <i>haha</i></p>
