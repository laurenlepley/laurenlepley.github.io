        <i><h2> What led me to pursure art?</h2></i>
    <br/>

    <p> Art has always been a defining passion for me. It was something I could always go to as a means of expressing myself. I took several art classes throughout my highschool journey and I can never remember a time where I didn't feel happy becuase of it. Art allows me to be myself and I have the freedom to create whatever comes to my mind. Colors are beautiful and I enjoy the ability to use them. I also felt that I never had to be better than anyone else when it came to art because I had my own style. Choosing Studio Art as a carrer may bring skepticism to other people but it is truly something that I want to do the rest of my life. </p>

        <i><h2> Most used art mediums?</h2></i>

    <br>

    <p> The mediums that I use the most are oil paint, watercolor paint, and graphite pencils. During my years in highschool, I really only every painted using acrylics because that is the medium I had the most access to. I enjoyed it but the saying that "once you try oil paint, you'll never go back to acrylic" is absolutely true. The ability to go back to the same spot and continue blending or critquing days after the initial paint has been applied is truly helpful. Once I got used to oils and tried to paint with acrylics, I had the hardest time because of how fast the paint ended up drying. Oil paint also gives much richer colors- the jewel tones are beautiful and help liven up the painting to its fullest extent. Watercolor paints are almost opposite of oils. They can dry fast like acrylic and they have softer colors. However, I find a charm with watercolors. I fell in love with them my senior year of highschool where I had more freedom to use mediums without a project requirement. Graphite pencils are a staple for artists. Whether they're used to draw sketches for larger artworks or detailed shading, graphite pencils are most likely one of the most used mediums for artists. Whenever I make art without using paints, I end up uding graphite pencils.</p>
